== Quick note on the SoundChannel problem ==

To maintain complete transparent backwards compatibility with the Sound API, AS3WavSound would need to support _soundChannel.stop()_, which currently is impossible. The reason for this is because SoundChannel has been declared _final_ by Adobe's developers. And so it cannot be subclassed to redefine behavior for stop() to stop playing a WavSoundChannel. No work-around is currently known.
