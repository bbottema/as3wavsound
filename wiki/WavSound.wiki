WavSound is the class in the AWS library that encapsulates the playback API just as Adobe's [http://www.adobe.com/livedocs/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/media/Sound.html Sound] class does. It supports all methods the standard Sound class does. On calling `.play()` a WavSoundChannel object is returned for runtime playback operations which has the same API as Adobe's [http://www.adobe.com/livedocs/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/media/SoundChannel.html SoundChannel].
