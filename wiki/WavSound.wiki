WavSound is the class in the AWS library that encapsulates the playback API just as Adobe's [http://www.adobe.com/livedocs/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/media/Sound.html Sound] class does. It supports all methods the standard Sound class does. On calling `.play()` a WavSoundChannel object is returned for runtime playback operations which has the same API as Adobe's [http://www.adobe.com/livedocs/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/media/SoundChannel.html SoundChannel].

Originally WavSound simply extended the Sound class and added the ability to decode WAVE data. However, since AWS needed to use its own SoundChannel derivative, WavSoundChannel, to act on simple methods such as `.stop()` (also see: [SoundChannelBug Quick note on the SoundChannel problem]), WavSound could no longer support the Sound API which returns the standard SoundChannel. And so true backwards compatibility was lost.
